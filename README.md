The development of this project aimed to provide invaluable support to the Offshore Installa-tion Manager (OIM) of Maersk Drilling's Maersk Voyager Drillship. By addressing the challenge of manually checking numerous statutory certificates each day to identify upcoming due dates, the project sought to streamline operations and alleviate the administrative burden for the OIM. Leveraging Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), a program was created to automate the process. Through seamless integration with Microsoft Outlook and discreet lookup within the MS Excel records of certificates, the program automatically generates timely reminders for cer-tificate renewals, ensuring continuous monitoring and tracking while significantly improving efficiency.
